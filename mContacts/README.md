A local notification is a type of notification that is generated and delivered by a mobile app on a user's device.

Local notifications can be used for a variety of purposes, such as reminding users about upcoming events or tasks, notifying them about new content or updates, or providing them with important information or alerts. They can be customized to include text, images, sounds, and other types of media, and can be scheduled to appear at specific times or intervals.
Local notifications are an important tool for mobile app developers, as they provide a way to keep users engaged with their apps and informed about important information. They are supported by most major mobile platforms, including iOS and Android, and can be implemented using a variety of programming languages and frameworks.
