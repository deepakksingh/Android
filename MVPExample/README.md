A local notification is a type of notification that is generated and delivered by a mobile app on a user's device.
MVP stands for Model-View-Presenter, which is a design pattern used in software engineering to separate an application's user interface (UI) from its business logic.

In the MVP pattern, the UI consists of two components: the View and the Presenter. The Model contains the business logic and data storage.

Here is an overview of the three components:

Model: The Model component represents the application's business logic and data storage. It contains the data and methods to manipulate that data.

View: The View component represents the UI of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data from the Model to the user and for capturing user input.

Presenter: The Presenter component acts as a mediator between the View and the Model. It receives input from the View, processes that input, and updates the Model as necessary. It also retrieves data from the Model and updates the View with that data.

The main advantage of using the MVP pattern is that it allows for a clean separation of concerns between the UI and the business logic, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
